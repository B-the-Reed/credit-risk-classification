Module 20 Challenge for UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp (2023)

This repository contains my submission for the Supervised Learning Challenge (Module 20) for the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp. 

Please open the markdown file labeled "Credit_Risk_Analysis_Report" to review the project question and an overview of the supervised machine learning models. The credit_risk_classification.ipynb file contains my code for both machine learning models developed for the assignment. 

I collaborated with classmate Portia Pray on this assignment in study groups.
